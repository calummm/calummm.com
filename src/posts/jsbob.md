A simple game I made using javascript when I should have being paying attention in a Java course. Atwood's Law eh. It is crude and old but has some charm?

The entire game runs on the dom so in theory this could be inject onto any site with a bit of tweaking.

<script>
  import JsBob from '$lib/games/jsbob/Js-Bob.svelte';
</script>
