Hello. My name is Calum.

This is obviously the first post in what I hope will become a decent sized blog. I hope by committing to attempting to, hopefully, have at least one commit per day to Github, this will encourage me to be more consistent. said every dev ever. Wish me luck.

## What this, or any blog, needs

- [framework](#framework)
- [organised structure](#organised-structure)
- [style system](style-system)
- [Consistant coding patterns](consistant-coding-patterns)
- SEO
- Open graph
- Comment system
- Branching rules
- Who cares about cookies anyway
- theming
- A commitment to not be a jerk

## Framework

Professionally, I work with Angular and have been a big proponent of using it as my team is large and the opinionated nature of Angular worked well to provide that quality outcome. However, it is time to try something new in my personal coding adventures and Svelte and Sveltekit caught my eye. Here is a library (platform?) that promised a clean, intuitive and quick approach to what has historically been a complicated process.

Firing up Sveltekit for the first time I was a little confused. The whole dev compile time amounted to less than 10 seconds. That cannot be right, I thought, coming from empty Angular projects taking upwards of 30 seconds and some mature projects taking as many as 20 minutes to compile for production.

There are a lot of good articles out there on how to make blogs with libraries and tools such as Gatsby and the like. I wanted more control and wanted to practice a new framework so I decided on Sveltekit.

There are a lot of good articles already for creating blogs with Sveltekit such as :
